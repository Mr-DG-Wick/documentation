# Documentation

This repository's purpose is to keep track of the knowledge around the Jenkins infrastructure project.
It gathers information for the following areas:

* "Maintenance" section contains document used to prepare service maintenances like systems upgrade.
* "Meeting" section contains meeting notes
* "Service" section contains service descriptions

The contribution workflow depends on either you want a "synchronous" or "asynchronous" communication.

In the cased of "synchronous" communication, use [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/team/jenkins-infra) with documents linked in the `jenkins-infra` channel. Once the collaboration is done, a maintainer needs to push the document into this repository.
Feel free to request access, our goals is only to avoid spammers.

In the case of "asynchronized" communication, it's better to use the git trunk-based development as it gives more time
to contributors to provide feedback, and it integrates better with Github notifications.

They are cases where documentation lies somewhere else like the private repository [jenkins-infra/runbook](github.com/jenkins-infra/runbooks), in those cases, it's better to provide a link from this repository, referencing thirds document elsewhere. The purpose is to use jenkins-infra/documentation as the central source of knowledge but to keep the ability to have information where it belongs.

## Contributing

They are different ways to contribute to this repository.

### Request specific documentation

Whatever your motivation is, either specific information needs or just curiosity, feel free to request content documentation, smaller the request is and easier documenting it will be.
To request specific documentation, you can open a [Jira](https://issues.jenkins.io) issue on the 'INFRA' project using the component name "documentation" and then assign it to the right person.
