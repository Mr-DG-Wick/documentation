## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. Jenkins 2.305 weekly has been released
    * Mark to run the weekly release checklist
    * QEMU configuration may not persist in certain environments, now we initialize in every case
    * Multi-arch images have been built, not yet published
    * Hope to share next week that we have multi-arch images
2. Preparing for Aug 25, 2021 release of Jenkins 2.302.1 LTS
    * JDK 11 as the default JDK for Docker images that do not specify a specific JDK (`latest`, `lts`, `lts-alpine`, `2.302.1-slim`, ...)
    * JDK8 should be kept, but defined explicitly (e.g. `latest-jdk8` for instance)
    * Need to audit release process changes, assure that the stable branch includes the latest from master branch
            * @MarkEWaite add audit step to the Jenkins release checklist

## Attendees

* @MarkEWaite 
* @dduportal 
* Aditya Srivastava

## Notes :book:

* Docker progress
  * Docker Agents: https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-agent/pull/182
  * Recent improvements for `docker buildx bake` is now being applied to Docker agents (jenkinsci/docker-agents)
      * Foundation for inbound, outbound, and other agents
      * Tim did some cleanup, enabled parallel testing
      * Goal: Shrink build and test time on Linux
      * One test away from merging the change
      * Build performance 4x better
      * Test performance improved 10%
      * Build and test is now 4-5 minutes instead of 20
      * Using this to clarify the tags being applied
      * Removed some unused and unmaintained Windows images
      * Windows is next for performance improvements
  * Next week for inbound and outbound agents
      * Considering a merge of multiple repositories to a single repository
      * Single agent repository, others archived
      * Single build process instead of build process per repo
      * Email and discourse discussion coming soon
      * May further accelerate build and test performance
* Replacement of archives.jenkins.io is online
    * @olblak running on Arm machine on Oracle Cloud
    * Synchronization of the archive has been improved
    * Need to monitor costs, assure we are within budget
        * As of 2021-08-03, we've spent less than $100 on Oracle hosting services
    * Rackspace machine will be stopped in 1-2 weeks
        * Machine started with Ubuntu 12
    * Validated new process with puppet code on Jenkins infra
        * No longer using a staging branch
        * Deploy to production faster, with more confidence
        * More improvements to test harness pending
        * Four pull requests deployed in a single day
        * Dependencies updated on the puppet stack
            * Puppet modules updated
        * ServerSpec part not yet ready, in progress
        * Validated process, reduced costs, and deployed
        * Well documented and shared knowledge
    * Not visible on the mirror list is current behavior but may be adjusted in the future
        * Still used as a fallback if no repo has file
* ci.jenkins.io
  * Agent CasC is ready, CasC reload implemented yesterday
  * We made a mistake either by plugin upgrade or other change
      * Before previous weekly release, we lost the EC2 and the Kubernetes configuration
      * Think it may have been an incomplete plugin upgrade
      * Deployed the CasC configuration on Puppet
      * Reused the config.yaml that had been depoyed before
      * Restored agent configuration in less than an hour
      * Have updated the VM templates and merged, confirmed the new version is deployed on ci.jenkins.io
      * Implemented CasC reload instead of safeRestart
          * Reload avoids a restart (remains responsive)
      * Check with the security team that update process is OK with the CasC updates
          * Security team must not be blocked by CasC code
* Start to work (@dduportal @zvW_c6ROSOOuJDTOracA7Q) on ACI -> Kubernetes
    * Starting to move some workload from ACI to Kubernetes
        * Tim and Damien working together
        * Saw many errors in bom builds
        * The ACI agents were struggling for CPU
            * Since ACI agents are containers, can start with bom process to see how it works with Kubernetes agents
            * Translate ACI agent config to pod templates
          * Static machines in the Kubernetes cluster
              * Will take this step by step
              * Striving to not break existing developer flow
      * Once we work with Kubernetes, we can use other providers like DigitalOcean and Scaleway
          * Specific workload, specific labels for now
          * Developers continue to use labels
              * Maintainers can use pod template
  * Enabling falco to limit Docker images
      * Keep the cluster stateless, able to flush weekly
  * Credential rotation in the future, sync with security
* Terraform 1.0 support for AWS + Datadog (+ Digital Ocean + Scaleway)
  * Evaluation started by Damien on AWS (update modules and syntax), draft PR incoming
  * Preparing a new image that allows multi-cluster
      * Using Terraform 1.0 as a long term support release
* How is archives.jenkins.io sync maintained?
    * Damien described the scripts that are used

## Action Points :muscle:

* Todo - @MarkEWaite add audit step to the Jenkins release checklist (**done** - [PR-177](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/release/pull/177))
