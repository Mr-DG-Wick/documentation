## Announcement :loudspeaker:

.1 Stable release tomorrow [2.277.4]

## Notes :book:

* Azure Account Cost
  * Network Bandwidth cost increased from \$215 (11/2020) to \$1643 (03/2021) for the K8s  cluster
    * No mirrors from the k8s cluster
* Add wiki again
  * Widely distributed information in many different Google Docs, other docs
      * Difficult to find our information, not centralized, not visible
      * Can easily lose access to the Google Doc
      * Practical problem of a sprawling collection of documents
      * Heavy dependence on Google Docs and others as a free service
  * Used wiki previously for meeting notes and collaborative doc editing
  * Wiki spam overwhelmed our wiki admin
  * Google docs, HackMD, GitHub gists, GitHub wikis, other repo content now
  * Should we consider a new wiki?
      * Not for technical documentation
      * Notes for infra meeting, notes for governance meeting
      * Needs a real-time collaboration edit facility
      * Consider asking Linux Foundation to host a Confluence for us
  * Confluence backed by Jenkins LDAP?
      * Permission management automation, maintainers only (RPU)
  * Self-hosted copy of Etherpad (https://etherpad.org/ - MD support: https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/695#issuecomment-16213353)
  * HackMD as a shared editor
  * [jenkins-infra/documentation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation/pull/13/file)
