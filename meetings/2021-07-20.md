## Notes :book:

* Puppet enterprise update from 2019.0.0 to 2019.8.0 [upgrade notes](https://hackmd.io/eKiavk5JQNSXPgtxMtHaGA?view)
    * Upgrade needed to use Oracle Cloud Arm computers to host archives.jenkins.io
    * Tasks identified for the next major upgrade
    * Puppet 7 is the next stable version, September
    * Minor features to be completed before archives.jenkins.io moves from Rackspace to Oracle Cloud
        * Puppet code update
        * Data provisioning to archives.jenkins.io (switch from push to pull model)
            * Mirrors fetch on their own schedule
            * See the pull request
    * archives.jenkins.io on oracle cloud using arm machine
* [Artifactory](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org) - investigating issues with Jfrog
    * JFrog upgrade to JFrog cloud complicated the Jenkins security release
    * Able to workaround on security delivery
    * Workaround has now been removed
    * Working with JFrog on a copy performance issue
* Docker images:
  * jenkinsci/docker: Multi-Arch + Faster Linux build & tests
      * @zvW_c6ROSOOuJDTOracA7Q has improved build times and added multi-architecture base capability
          * We have a limited number of specific machines (Arm64, ppc64le, s390x)
          * Test harness issues to be resolved
              * Some bad tests to remove
              * Performance improvements coming
              * Structuring the lists of test targets and removing duplication
  * jenkinsci/jnlp-agent: Windows Java Agents upgraded to Maven 3.8.1 thanks t @zvW_c6ROSOOuJDTOracA7Q  and @jglick
      * Using same maven version on ACI agents as on others
      * Packer image repository builds the operating system images for our agents
      * Uses the same scripting to build AWS, Azure, 
      * Proposal to build the ci.jenkins.io agent images with the same Packer technique
          * Adds a new provider to the Packer build process
              * Adds Docker provider to existing AMD64, Arm64 images
      * Kubernetes and ACI need a bare minimum agent image
          * Use specific agents for those scopes
          * ACI maven and maven-windows are not minimum agent images
              * Include Java, Maven, etc.
          * Would stop use of the jnlp-agent images on ci.jenkins.io
          * Will create a proof of concept for initial exploration
