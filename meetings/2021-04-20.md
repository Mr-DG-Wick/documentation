## Notes :book:

* get.jenkins.io - Azure File Disk outage
  * Outage - mirror that redirects users to their nearest mirror
    * About 5:00 PM UTC the Azure File Storage stopped responding
        * Disk quota (open file handes) exceeded quickly reached
        * Mirrorbits could not decide which file to distribute
    * Fallback to a service that was using the same file storage
        * Made the overload even worse on the file storage
    * Two hours, same issue we'd seen in Nov 2020
        * redirected get.jenkins.io traffic to pkg.jenkins.io (all files)
        * That machine will be overloaded during peak hours (temp solution)
      * Opened a PowerShell connection to list the open files to Azure storage
          * Hard limit of 2000 connections
          * A single session had almost completely consumed the 2000
          * Missing some observability to understand exact issue
          * Used the same command from Nov 2020, add to runbook
      * Once file storage was unavailable, many other failure modes
  * status.jenkins.io
      * used the status page to notify the community of the outage
      * Status page monitoring did not show the service as down
          * Service was responding to HTTP requests for root page
          * Need to monitor service
          * Nov 2020 we saw that some files (plugins) 503 while others did not
  * file access
    * monitoring
    * apache file access
    * mirrorbits scan
      * Datadog - https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2959
        * [basic monitoring](https://p.datadoghq.com/sb/0Igb9a-246463485af45b9c9d2347fd1b20f2a4)
        * [package can be downloaded](https://p.datadoghq.com/sb/0Igb9a-e6849e5e019250ef5aaea3589297fe8b) 
            * Download was "flapping" during the outage, pass, then fail
      * k8s healthchecks
  * runbooks improvements to be made (see actions points)
* www.jenkins.io cd workflow
  * Switching to use Docker image to deliver www.jenkins.io to production
      * Previously used Azure file storage sync, without deletion
  * Bots can't commit to GitHub protected branch
  * Multiple alternatives to implement, not yet a consensus
      * Shall we use the IEP (https://github.com/jenkins-infra/iep/) process to
          * State goals
          * Describe measures
          * Identify alternatives and how to evaluate
      * Olivier used a similar process 4 years ago for www.jenkins.io site
          * Current (old) repository for IEPs: <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/iep/>
          * Consider placing the IEP in the <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation> (next to the hackmd's notes for meetings, runbooks, etc.)
* Websockets
    * k8s control plane has thresholds that we are exceeding
    * Throttling happens when we exceed thresholds
    * Jenkins controller uses control plane request to deploy agents
        * Websocket used to communicate with containers
        * Errors seem to be correlated with agent communication
    * Can Azure monitoring help us see the failure as it happens
        * Azure seems to show user agent of each request, may help
        * Good to identify the service limits
        * Check with others in the community for their experiences
            * Jenkins-X recommends turning down polling for secrets
            * Other high demand likely from helmfile
                * Full deploy / check very frequently
            * Ask friends at Elastic in case they have insights
    * Not clear how to diagnose inside Jenkins



## Action Points :muscle:

* @olblak Propose an IEP for the www.jenkins.io deployment process
* @olblak Move [jenkins-infra/IEP](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/IEP) to [jenkins-infra/documentation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation)
* @dduportal Investigate websocket solutions
* @dduportal Runbooks to write in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation for the following topics @dduportal (review by @olblak + @MarkEWaite )
    *  How to fallback the *.get.jenkins.io to pkg.jenkins.io
    *  How to identify (and fix) the Azure File Storage's file handle issue with Olivier's scripts
    *  Service pkg.jenkins.io
    *  Service get.jenkins.io 
    *  Service fallback.jenkins.io services
