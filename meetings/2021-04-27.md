    * Kubernetes
    * Puppet
    * Monitoring/Alerting/Status 
    * CI/Shared libraries
    * ?
* [Documentation](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/documentation)
    * Synchronous
    * Asynchronous
    * IEP: wip
    * runbooks: started in jenkins-infra/documentation and already updated :heart_decoration: .
* infra.ci:
    * Websocket issues: No more issues since last meeting. AKS API not throttled anymore. Note sure about what went correct though
    * Improved performances by tuning the Casc/DSL config
        * Clean up orphan childs: less I/O when restarting
        * Fixed an EC2 configuration breaking change
        * More cleanup to apply, and more native DSL keywording
* Datadog Configuration as code using Terraform
    * Build fixed (terraform 0.13 and latest datadog module) - [INFRA-2921](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2921) => we can define SLO and improve monitoring... again :)
    * Moved to infra.ci - [INFRA-2922](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2922) => removing critical credentials from ci.jenkins.io
* ci.jenkins.io: 
    * Kubernetes agents ready to go, using EKS.
        * Tested succesfully with jenkins-infra/datadog and with jenkins-infra/packer_images
        * Websocket not usable: to be checked (smells like reverse-proxy config). Using JNLP for now
    * What about spot instances to decrease costs?
    * WiP on packer images (upgrade VMs)
    * WDYT: build both containers and VM with packer for ci agents?
* New Git Repositories
    * [jenkins-infra/uc](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/uc)
    * [jenkins-infra/jenkins-version](https//github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-version)
    * [jenkins-infra/captain-hook](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/captain-hook)
