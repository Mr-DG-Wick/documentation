# Meetings

EverJenkins infrastructure contributors gather on a video call to share progress, discuss ongoing issues, or communicate about coming work.
Everybody is invited to participate, we want to take this opportunity to have an interactive discussion or just bring awareness to specific topic.

Meetings are announced on the Jenkins [agenda](https://www.jenkins.io/event-calendar/).
If for some reason a meeting is canceled, then it's usually communicated either on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/jenkins-infra), or in the [chat](https://www.jenkins.io/chat/#jenkins-infra)

Usually, the agenda is announced one or two days in advance so we can come prepared, feel free to add any content you want to discuss.

## Notes
Before the 13th of April 2021, notes were taken on a [google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uNneXKcIYrpBtfkkfWvtSWYgZ-6rgf4YvCqxJqBU1yg), we now have one document per meeting. We use hackmd.io to collaboratively take notes during the meeting and then at the end of the meeting, someone pushes the notes in this directory. Feel free to request access, our goal is only to avoid spammers.

## Record
