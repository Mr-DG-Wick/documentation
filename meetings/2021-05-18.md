## Attendees

* @olblak
* @MarkEWaite
* @dduportal
* Daniel Beck
* Aditya Srivastava

## Announcement :loudspeaker:

1. /

## Notes :book:

* Puppet Agent certificate expiration
  * Puppet out of sync since +- 2months
    * Didn't detect the expiration or the loss of sync
    * Renewed the certificate on puppet master
    * Renew the certificate on each puppet agent
  * Done: archives, VPN, ci.jenkins.io
    * Detected some agents that were out of sync
  * Still work in process (other machines)
* AWS sponsoring
  * Confirmed AWS sponsorship of $60 000
  * Technical implementation to prevent accounting issues
    * Split account to CDF or
    * Transfer account to independent organization
* Scaleway sponsoring
  * They are OK to cut down any bill of ~ 600 euro per month (double check)
    * Region is further away that US East Coast
    * If interested to assist, contact @olblak or @dduportal
  * We need to create an account: Damien to check if need a credit card
* Agents on our CI environments
  * Challenge of MiTM for the initial SSH connection vs. Fast starting agent
    * Regularly update the operating system and tools on the agents
    * Using images from Dec 2020 (not latest Java, not latest OS)
    * AWS auth requires that the instance is running, configured, and services running before it will print the fingerprint to the console
    * Used safety check that the SSH fingerprint, but slows connection
      * We build the AMI ourselves
      * Operate inside a private network
      * Currently choosing to "stay safe" rather than fast startup
    * Linux AMD and ARM run Docker as an unprivileged process
      * Use unprivileged user on Linux
  * Windows: updated, WIP on azure Windows, keeping unprivileged user because no rootless Docker (and creating a user is surprisingly hard on Windows)
    * Windows does not have an unprivileged user that runs Docker
  * Desire to have same configuration for agents on
    * ci.jenkins.io
    * trusted.ci.jenkins.io
    * release.ci.jenkins.io
    * infra.ci.jenkins.io
    * Reusable CI agents highly desirable
* ci.jenkins.io: 
  * start working on CasC for the scope "agents/clouds"
  * Current cloud configuration is large, prone to errors
* Discourse trial
  * Discussions as a possible forum with threaded conversations
  * Possibly use as a Jenkins user forum
  * Deploying our own server was not a great experience previously
  * 14 day trial is running now
    * If you're willing to be involved, check with @olblak 
    * @dduportal used Discourse for the traefik open source community
    * Many integrations, plugins, etc. that provide nice service
  * Sponsorship as a managed service may be possible
    * Open source design uses a sponsored service also
      * @kB_yaTxnRYiRgiB6BgSZvA also willing to assist
    * If not sponsored, would cost $1200 per year
    * Jenkins project a good candidate for their open source program
* Azure account cost controls started
  * May need further reductions, the $1000 reduction likely not enough
  * Spreading workload onto others agents a very good step

## Action Points :muscle:
