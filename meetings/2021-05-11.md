## Notes :book:

* Add wiki again
  * Discussion happening on [mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-infra/c/UJ-uWm2F0Ww)
* LFX Security
  * Discussion happening on [mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-infra/c/i02y5tw0pAU)
  * LFX demo from David Deal (LF)
  * v1 focus on dependencies
      * visualise data
  * v2 integrate with bluebracket in addition of Snyk
      * Available in the coming weeks
      * snyk scan repositories including docker images
      * bluebracket will be able to analyse credentials leak
      * A downside to consider, is that it reviews the entire Git history
      * Can provide remediation link
      * Do we have repositories that we shouldn't monitor?
          * snyk focus on software and not so much about infrastructure
          * bluebracket, doesn't really care about the technology
      * We need a new GitHub app for LFX
          * We'll start with a small set of repositories
      * Docker image maybe not the best one to start because we can't use another file that the default "Dockerfile" at the repository root
          * We don't have access to snyk api "just" lfx layer
          * We definitely have git repositories that would work as [docker-jenkins-lts](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docker-jenkins-lts)
      * Tim worries about noise.
* JEP-229 - increased dependencies on infrastructure
  * 
  * ci.jenkins.io - plugins can't be released if jobs cannot complete
  * trusted - plugins can't be deployed if credentials are not up to date 
  * oleg suggestion: 
    * Get Tim documentation merged but do not recommand to use it officially 

**Running out of time**, let move the remaining topics to next week

* Discourse, exploratory mode
* Ingress Controller Update
  * [Notes](https://hackmd.io/cH4rbENeSOGLHD3rAgnXqQ)
  * No downtime !!
* Releases and release automation
  * Weekly releases
    * Weekly release GitHub changelog publish automatically?
    * Thread started in the [infra mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkins-infra/c/rXE5qj6fK6M/m/c8Lo3HQ0AQAJ)
  * LTS releases
    * Need release lead for 2.289.1 and for later 2.289.x releases
    * Needs further discussion
* Windows agent on our CI environment
