## Announcement :loudspeaker:



## Notes :book:

* Jfrog support with repo.jenkins-ci.org
  * [Meetin note](https://hackmd.io/l5bmfIprRAa-EtFgxcL5dA)
  * Lock on Database due to the limit of connection reached
      * Met with JFrog last week to diagnose issues
  * Last security release promoting artifact from staging to production
      * Resolved, but discovered we were using an undersized database
      * Increased size of database
      * Took 1 hour to copy the artifact instead of a few secons
  * Connected with JFrog support to investigate and debug
      * Increased logging level, not yet understanding 1 hour copy
  * Once more information is available, plan another session
* Digital Ocean account
    * Digital Ocean has donated to Jenkins project
    * Created a Digital Ocean account, invited Gavin and Damien
    * Provision a small k8s cluster to provide agents to ci.jenkins.io
    * Need a volunteer to help write the Terraform code
        * Contact Damien to be involved
* Rackspace
  * archives.jenkins.io
  * Running a new machine (arm64) on Oracle Cloud
  * Changing the distribution of artifacts
      * Previously performed a push
      * Now we pull artifacts from an rsync server (OSU-USL)
      * Allows us to add more mirrors in other regions
  * Oracle Cloud costs look very good for hardware
      * Will need to monitor costs for Oracle bandwidth
  * Would like help with Terraform for Oracle infrastructure
* ci.jenkins.io jcasc - agents configured as code
    * Thursday apply the change
    * Puppet code has issues, some that affect production, others local test
    * Time to production is slowed by our use of the staging branch
        * Delays impact our iteration of changes like this
        * Proposing to remove the staging branch tomorrow morning
            * Assure that merging a pull request will deploy to production
            * @olblak supports the removal of staging branch
            * The staging branch is not helping our current processes
        * Should the default branch be "production"?
            * For now, yes
            * Separate change later
        * [PR#1810](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra/pull/1810)
        * Agent configuration on ci.jenkins.io after branch change
            * Puppet issues that may affect ci.jenkins.io
            * Using a different user ID (999)
            * Default home user is using Jenkins home on host file system
                * Sometimes correct, other times a Docker parameter
                * Puppet runs on ci.jenkins.io consistently report errors
                * Default user has home directory that does not exist
                    * /var/lib/jenkins does not exist on that machine
                    * Historical change from when we installed with apt
                * Same pattern on trusted.ci.jenkins.io
                    * Need to fix the errors, puppet errors not good
* Docker Multi Arch progress and status report
    * Good progress.
    * On our roadmap for over year.
    * Timja did all the work.
    * Damien implemented parallel testing
    * Today's weekly build used much of the code
        * Minor bumps, only build and test multi-arch for now
        * Will publish an image today, will not be multi-arch
    * Current limitation
        * behavior on trusted is different than ci
        * we rely Qemu at the moent and we'll investigate for real machine
    * Time to build went from 25min to 12  
    * Looking for help with Window support
        

## Action Points :muscle:

* Announce the multi arch JEP - @MarkEWaite
