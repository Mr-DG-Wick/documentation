      * Weekly release outage for Windows agents, windows container paths
          * Fixed by @dduportal, see his post-mortem document
          * https://status.jenkins.io/issues/2021-05-25-weekly-windows/
          * See Damien's recommendations: short term, medium term, long term
          * Damien's template
              * Chronology
              * Impact
      * ACI agents unavailable on ci.jenkins.io
          * Should have used tags, state, and project
          * Once closed, push the document to GitHub as final record
          * Committed the change from HackMD.io
          * Includes markdown-lint to report issues 
  * hackmd.io
* Freenode
    * Migrated from Freenode to Libera.chat last week
    * Created channels, migration is almost complete for Jenkins infra
        * Puppet notifications are now sent to Libera.chat
    * Migrated infrabutler, ircbot, element.io profiles are now bridged
* Discourse
    * Sponsored by the company behind Discourse
    * Seeking feedback during this experimental phase
        * Authentication
            * Account management by Discourse or another SSO?
            * If Discourse, can enable multiple SSO integrations
        * Categorization
            * Draft categories
                * Using Jenkins
                * Community
                * Contributing
                * Site Feedback
                * Staff
                * Lounge
                * Uncategorized
        * Discussion is active on the dev mailing list
* Azure cost
  * eks pods
      * Costs did not decrease as expected even though we stopped mirrors
  * ci.jenkins.io - $6k in virtual machines and container instances
      * Not clear which options we need to reduce to save money
      * Consider using Kubernetes pods to reduce costs
      * Workload is increasing on that instance, how can we identify the split between virtual machines, container instances, and more
      * Needs more measurement to understand our costs
      * Open telemetry data may help us understand location of costs
      * Days or weeks between a change and measurable impact on costs
  * Still above the $10k budget per month
      * Needs more investigation to save money on the account
* Observability
    * Needs a future session with Elasticsearch
* rsync
    * The archives.jenkins.io machine 
        * includes all Jenkins releases and plugin releases
        * does not provide rsync service
        * Removed from mirroring infrastructure
    * Available for rsync from specifically allowed IP addresses
        * From pkg.origin.jenkins.io
        * From get.jenkins.io
        * Others could be added if they want to mirror all files
    * Other mirrors only retain last 1 year of data
        * Some mirrors retain more than 1 year, but are still based on the initial 1 year copy from OSU-OSL
        * The archives.jenkins.io machine is still bandwidth limited
        * Not expected to handle the load
        * New plugins are not expected to fallback to archives, only files older than one year

## Action Points :muscle:
