* Stability Issues
  * [updates.jenkins.io](https://updates.jenkins.io)
  * [get.jenkins.io](https://get.jenkins.io), wrong mirror redirection
    * [Wrong mirrors](https://get.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins_2.288_all.deb?mirrorlist) - seeking additional help to investigate
    * https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues/321
    * https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2949
* jenkins.io website new continuous delivery [workflow](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/updateCli/updateCli.d/charts.yaml)
  * Current implementation pushes files to a network storage without delete
  * Gavin Mogan @halkeye sought a solution, simplify deployment
  * Build Docker image from infra.ci, publish to Dockerhub
  * Increment the helm chart to reference the new Docker image
  * Need to include updatecli use the same technique
  * Previewing a change as part of a pull request?
    * Would be nice to have that facility, not available yet
    * Could deploy to a kubernetes cluster for PR preview sites
    * Could use a service like netlify or surge.sh to host previews
    * Would prefer to host it in our own kubernetes service
    * Reducing the effort to submit a documentation change
* Last security release was cumbersome
  * websocket timeout error
    * After cluster update we'll investigate further
    * Need some measurements to see current status
  * tcp timeout error
  * ssh-agent issues from windows container
    * Currently locked on an older version
    * Either need to adapt our configuration or fix bug in ssh-agent
  * Daniel Beck reminds that we need staged packaging
  
* Open question, One page per meeting or one single page for everything meetings?
  * Mark in favor of one page per meeting with date in file name
* Where to put meeting notes?
  * jenkins-infra/documentation or jenkins-infra/jenkins.io
    * Mark in favor of jenkins-infra/documentation in order to not take the risk of breaking the website, at least for now
