# Runbook: Geographical Download Redirector (get.jenkins.io)

## Description


get.jenkins.io is a "Geographical Download Redirector" based on [mirrorbits](https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits).

Its goal is to redirect an HTTP file download request to a mirror which is closed geographically, or to answer the request using [fallback.get.jenkins.io](./fallback.get.jenkins.io.md).
