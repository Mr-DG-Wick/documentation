# Runbook: Fallback File Download Service (fallback.get.jenkins.io)

## Description

fallback.get.jenkins.io is file download service for the Jenkins projects.
It serves through HTTP all the files to be downloaded: plugins, war file, packages, etc.

It's used as fallback when [Geographical Download Redirector (get.jenkins.io)](./get.jenkins.io.md) fails to find a mirror to redirect the request to, or when a directory listing is used.
